About me
======
My name is Jiazhou Xu/ Xu, Jiazhou (许嘉洲 in Chinese). I am a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in theoretical physics at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). 

I was born and raised in a small village named Beiwangzhuang (small enough that you can't even find it on Wiki) in [Zhengding county](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengding_County), Hebei province. Where I lived a wonderful childhood. 

I started my first research in astrophysics at [Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Fudan University](https://astro.fudan.edu.cn/astro_en/), where I was supervised by [Prof. Suoqing Ji](https://astro.fudan.edu.cn/astro_en/7d/74/c45747a687476/page.htm), a smart, humble and really nice scholar. I was studying (mainly the survival of) a cold nabulae inside a young Super Star Cluster (SSC). I've learned a lot at Fudan thanks to Suoqing. However, I didn't finish that project because I could not manage everything after I came back to USTC. It's a pity.

In my spare time, I enjoy Chinese folk ballads, especially those by [Lei Zhao (赵雷)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Lei_(singer)). I also love traveling and have visited over 10 cities in China, always eager to explore new places.

Research interests
======
I am interested in theoretical astropysics and AI for Science (AI4S). I chose AI4S because of some reasons regarding reality. I'm quite new to this research area. Now I'm supervised by Prof. Jiancan Wu and co-supervised by Dr. Kai Cao. They helped me a lot to enter this area. Hopefully I can do some discovery.
