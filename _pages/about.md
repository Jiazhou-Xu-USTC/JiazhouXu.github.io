About me
======
My name is Jiazhou Xu/ Xu, Jiazhou (许嘉洲 in Chinese). I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in theoretical physics at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), with a keen interest in theoretical astrophysics. Currently, under the guidance of [Prof. Suoqing Ji](https://astro.fudan.edu.cn/astro_en/7d/74/c45747a687476/page.htm) and [Prof. Liang Dai](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/liang-dai), I conduct a numerical study of the cold gas nabula inside the Super Star Cluster (SSC) “[Godzilla](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10755)“

In my spare time, I enjoy Chinese folk ballads, especially those by [Lei Zhao (赵雷)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Lei_(singer)). I also love traveling and have visited over 10 cities in China, always eager to explore new places.

You can view my CV [here](assets/academicCV.pdf) or check the [CV page](https://jiazhou-xu-ustc.github.io/JiazhouXu.github.io///cv/). If you want to know more about me, please email me directly.

Research interests
======
I am particularly interested in theoretical astrophysics and currently use the [`Athena++`](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena/) code for hydro simulations to study the high-density cold gas nebula of "Godzilla". I am familiar with (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations and their applications to the interstellar medium (ISM). But as an undergraduate, I am eager to broaden my understanding of the universe through diverse fields of study.
