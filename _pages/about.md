About me
======
My name is Jiazhou Xu/ Xu, Jiazhou (许嘉洲 in Chinese).I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in theoretical physics at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), with a keen interest in theoretical astrophysics. Currently, under the guidance of [Prof. Suoqing Ji](https://astro.fudan.edu.cn/astro_en/7d/74/c45747a687476/page.htm) and [Prof. Liang Dai](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/liang-dai), I conduct a numerical study of the cold gas nabulae inside the Super Star Cluster (SSC) "[Godzilla](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10755)"

In my spare time, I enjoy Chinese folk ballads, especially those by [Lei Zhao (赵雷)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Lei_(singer)). I also love traveling and have visited over 10 cities in China, always eager to explore new places.
